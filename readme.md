# Status808

Status808 is a personal project turning the web browser into a musical instrument. Soundscapes are created related to keywords on the web page in view and are dynamically controlled through userâ€™s mouse gestures. 

The system uses:

- A custom chrome extension: Sending webpage content
- Python: Handling requests, text processing, sending API requests, local message sending through sockets
- Freesound API: Getting sounds
- MAX/MSP: Sound processing and interactive mouse control
